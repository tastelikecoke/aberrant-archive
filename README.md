# Note
## When using this repository, install this package:

Idk if it's possible to distribute this game while including these files so I'll just be cautious

# Introduction
Oh boy! 2 weeks have passed and I barely made anything for the Acerola Jam!
I spent a whole week learning Blender and only to create just one 3D model...
